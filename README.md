# Openframe Processing extension

This extension runs interactive [Processing](http://processing.org) sketches on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) within [Openframe](http://openframe.io) â€“ "an open source platform for artists, curators and art enthusiasts to share, discover and display digital art". 

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Recommended** version `2.x.x` of `openframe-processing` requires features of Openframe that are not avaialable in a release yet. To install Openframe from the latest `master` branch including those features, follow the official guide https://docs.openframe.io/#getting-started to prepare the installation. Replace the command in `2.2 Install Openframe` of the guide with `bash -c "$(curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jvolker/7be85a005b98fbd40b793d13b7250a44/raw/)"`. 
    -  Version  2.x.x adds support  for `.zip` files with contributed libraries. In earlier versions `.zip` are considered experimental as full extraction of the package is not guaranteed when the sketch is run.
- version `1.x.x` of `openframe-processing` works with `openframe` version `0.4.9`. Follow the [Openframe Getting started guide](https://docs.openframe.io/#getting-started)


### Instructions

Then, enter via the command line: `openframe -i openframe-processing`

This extension is based on `processing-java`. When Processing artwork is selected in the web app, the artwork gets downloaded to the Raspberry Pi where it's going to be compiled and run.


## Artwork

### How to upload artwork?

Follow the [adding artwork section](https://docs.openframe.io/#adding-artwork) of the Openframe docs and use `openframe-processing` as artwork format.

So far it supports URLs (`URL where the artwork is hosted`) to either a single `.pde` or a `.zip` file containing multiple `.pde` files and/or Processing libraries. If you package your sketch using ZIP make sure the `.zip` file is named the same as the sketch.  

### Where to host artwork?

https://docs.openframe.io/#hosting-artwork

### Processing libraries

You can ship contributed Processing and Java libraries with your artwork package in a `.zip` file. All libraries (usually `.jar` files) have to be in a `code` folder within your artwork package. More info here: https://discourse.processing.org/t/how-to-distribute-sketches-with-libraries-to-openframe/14095/9?u=jvolker This thread also discusses a convenience install script of most common Processing libraries which might be added in the future.


### Fullscreen

The extension loads all sketches in fullscreen by default. For some sketches this might not be useful. To disable fullscreen, add the following to the `options` property of the artwork in the database: 

```
{
  "fullscreen": false
}
```

The Openframe web app currently doesn't support this. Alternative ways to do this are [described in the Openframe docs](https://docs.openframe.io/#per-artwork-settings) .


## Todo

- hide cursor at all times (even when the mouse is moved)
- support for precompiled sketches
- add unit tests
